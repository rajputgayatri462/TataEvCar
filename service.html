                        Our EVs are powered by Ziptron technology. This means that it can charge from 0% to 80% in about an hour when being fast charged. You can also use regular charging option using any 15 ampere plug point, the timing for which will depend on the selected model. The great part about this is, you can charge your car at a charging station or at home or at work as well!

                        As an electric car company in India, we understand your apprehension about a new kind of powertrain. Ziptron EV architecture has been driven and proven over 1 Billion kms across India and is designed keeping in mind the extreme Indian weather conditions. That being said, the battery pack and motor used in our electric vehicles is IP67 certified which makes it weather and worry proof. In fact, our electric vehicle battery technology is so advanced that the battery pack comes with an impact resistant casing that meets AIS – 048 standards (nail penetration at cell level). Furthermore, dual airbags, ABS with EBD and CSC are the standard safety features across variants.

                        EVs have been present in India for over one and half decade. Given the options available, EVs were perceived as non-aspirational, expensive, low performance, slow moving machines which could only be used sparingly for leisure driving. Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited learnt that in order for potential buyers to even consider an EV, the abovementioned myths need to be busted. Additionally, it was important that Indian made electric cars were safe by ensuring that the right technology choices were made to suit Indian road conditions. These choices included liquid cooled batteries, high voltage systems and extensive testing.
Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited Ziptron EV architecture is designed keeping in mind the needs of an evolving EV customer. The early EVs in India were low voltage solutions. Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited sought to create an EV where the customer didn’t have to compromise. And so a practical, high voltage EV architecture was born – Ziptron.
Ziptron EV architecture is a state-of-the art high voltage EV technology designed for extreme Indian weather conditions and the challenging Indian terrain. It deploys unique software strategies perfected over millions of kilometers to extract maximum energy from the battery that is used in the electric vehicle. The high energy lithium-ion battery pack is liquid cooled to ensure stable operations over varied temperature ranges. Its Permanent Magnet Synchronous AC Motor delivers instant torque balancing performance with efficiency.
